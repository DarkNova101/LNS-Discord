### Thoughts

/request | creates a new tech request based on google sheets info 
- either search by name or create event id column in the sheet and use that to search
- switch from email tech requests to the first people to react to tech request work? Maybe make a way to have it based on senority



## API's 
Google Sheets Library
Discord Api
Microsoft Email?? <- see above may not use
