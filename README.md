### Thoughts

/request <row> | creates a new tech request based on google sheets info 
- either search by name or create event id column in the sheet and use that to search
- switch from email tech requests to the first people to react to tech request work? Maybe make a way to have it based on senority


Use Goolge Sheets API to get event info from row and use Outlook API to create a message draft of the tech request.
